COMPILER REQUIREMENTS AND EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Python version 2.6.6 was used in development and testing (default on hpdc02).


COMPILING FROM WORKFLOW TO SWAN CODES
------------------------------------
By executing: 

	make <WORKFLOW>

	where workflow will be one of - tfidf 
					kmeans 
`					tfidf_and_kmeans 
					tfidf_then_kmeans

	For examples -  make tfidf
			make kmeans
			make tfidf_and_kmeans     /* in-memory version */
			make tfidf_then_kmeans    /* file input/output version */

Here "WORKFLOW" matches the base name of the user's description of analytics query 
in JSON format.  The compiler will generate Swan code and compile with c++ compiler.


TESTING
-------

To run the codes generated for the workflow query against datasets specified in query run:

	make <test_TARGET>

	For examples:
			make test_tfidf
			make test_kmeans
			make test_tfidf_and_kmeans      /* in-memory version */
			make test_tfidf_then_kmeans     /* file input/output version */


COMPILING AND TESTING ALL
-------------------------

To generate swan, compile and run tests on each target in turn run:

	make all
